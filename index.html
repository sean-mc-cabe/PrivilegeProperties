                      Privilege Properties is happy to provide FREE, Sales and Rental valuations, at a time to suit you.</p>

<p>If you are thinking of moving house or have just purchased an investment property, the first, most important step is to find out what the property is worth....not some inflated and overly optimistic figure, but a genuine, realistic valuation on which you can base your sums.
We are happy to discuss all aspects of a prospective move and, in addition, very often, can help with advice on the property in which you are interested.</p>
<p>We will, of course, also discuss, in full, the cost implications of any decisions you may make.
<strong>It's all part of the service!</strong></p>

<p class="small">Please note that there may be a small fee due for professional, written valuations, say for a bank, or for a solicitor for matrimonial purposes.</p>

                  <h4>Rental</h4>
                  <p>
                   Whether an investor has one rented property, or a sizeable portfolio, it represents a major financial commitment.</p>
<p>Our responsibility is to maximise the return on that investment, only one element of which is making sure that we obtain the maximum rent possible. In many ways, almost more importantly, it is key that we find THE RIGHT TENANT, someone who will look after the property as if it was their own and who can meet their financial responsibilities.</p>
<p>We carry out extensive background checks on all potential tenants, as required by law and by good, simple, common sense....where possible, we check their financial background, their employment history and any previous rental experience. Very simply, if we wouldn't be happy letting a property we hypothetically own to a particular tenant, then we won't let them into a property you own.</p>
<p>We make sure that all tenants are fully aware of the commitments they are making and the responsibilities they are taking on. We also take from them a 'security deposit', which can be forfeited if they do not comply with the terms of their lease...and everything is lodged with the Tenancy Deposit Scheme, to make sure that everyone's interests are legally protected.</p>
                    <p>Of course, for investors, getting the correct property in the first place is vitally important, which is why we are happy to offer advice on any property they are interested in buying and to introduce contractors who can do any remedial work which is required. <strong>It's all part of the service!</strong>

                  <p>
                    Many landlords, understandably, want very little to do with the day to day detail surrounding their property and their tenancy. They may be living overseas, or maybe they're very busy in other aspects of their lives and, if so, what they want and need is an agent they can trust to look after ALL the many different elements of what makes up a successful investment....and that's where we come in!</p>
<p>Our service has been specifically designed to ensure that we tick every conceivable box....from checking the tenant in to the property, with the appropriate completion of an inventory form, to the collection of the rent, to chasing rent which is overdue, to fielding maintenance calls and arranging for any issues to be dealt with promptly, where possible, by one of our range of local North Belfast contractors. We make regular inspection visits to the property, to make sure that the tenant is looking after it as we would expect ....and we have a 24 hour 'help line' for emergencies.</p>
<p>We pride ourselves on attention to detail and compliance with every legal requirement is a given, plus we can advise on any changes in legislation BEFORE they happen.</p>
<p>We also believe that communication is hugely important and so we undertake to keep in touch with every landlord client as often as they require and in the manner in which they find it most convenient, be that face to face, over the telephone or via text or e mail. 
<strong>It's all part of the service!</strong></p>

                  <h4>Residential Sales</h4>
                  <p>
                    We believe that our extensive experience in the residential market, especially in North Belfast, enables us to provide extensive, in depth information on all aspects of a potential move and to do so with empathy and in the strictest confidence.</p>
<p>Key to our strategy is to ensure that the advice we provide is geared with only one thing in mind...that is that, at all times, it should be the best advice for you, the client...no equivocation, no conflict of interest, simply the best advice for you.</p>
<p>Our intention is to be there at every stage, to help navigate and, hopefully, avoid the various pitfalls which are out there. From realistic, pre sales valuations, to advice on property marketing and how to maximise...and handle...viewings. From how to achieve the best possible price, whilst being very open, fair and transparent with all interested parties to advice on surveys, mortgages and conveyancing...we can even, if asked, express an opinion on any property in which you are interested.</p>
                    <p>Our aim is simply to do everything in our power to help you make your move with as few complications as possible...and to do so at a very reasonable cost. <strong>It's all part of the service!</strong>

                      I have rented for the last 3 years with multiple different property lettings here in Belfast and I have never had a better experience with Gerard and Lisa, The difference between them and others is unmatched, always available to help, courteous, professional and the people you want to be dealing with, if you are trying anyone else, you are missing out. I would 100% recommend them if you are looking to rent.

                   When I spoke with Lisa she was very friendly and explained their letting service in detail (unlike another estate agent who just referred me to the website when I asked a question!). She advised me on the level of rent I should expect (higher than I expected) and listed the property online. When multiple applications came in, Gerard called me to talk through each one and arranged for me to meet the best applicants in person. Very efficient service, great communication, received the balance of deposit and paperwork very quickly. I would highly recommend Privilege Properties as they did a great job - from taking photos to agreeing a tenancy at the asking price took a week.

                I have spent the last 15 years learning the estate agency business, initially in residential sales and, more particularly, in lettings and management. The majority of that time has been spent in North Belfast, where I (and my husband) were born and bred, and I am very proud of the reputation that I have built up over the years, and have thoroughly enjoyed meeting such a wide range of customers. It has long been my goal to set up business here, providing a quality service to the North Belfast market, using, where possible, North Belfast contractors and suppliers. This is my home and where we are bringing up our 2 kids. I am very committed to putting something back in to the local community and I have just recently been appointed to serve on the Board of Governors of my son’s school and also serve on their PTA.

                I like to think of myself as a very practical and grounded individual, probably due, in no small part, to my North Belfast upbringing.
                I consider myself to be very much a “people person” and a straight talker and always try to treat everyone the way I would like my granny to be treated. I believe that there is nothing wrong with keeping things simple and my philosophy is to work hard, very hard, and to give each individual the advice which I think best serves their needs. As I have found out in my 7 years in the business, estate agency isn’t rocket science, but it is a business which can seem to many people to be extremely complicated. Our aim at Privilege Properties is to remove any mystery and to take the business back to its basic simplicity.
